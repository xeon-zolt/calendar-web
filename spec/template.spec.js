assert.notEqual(actual, expected, [message])
Tests shallow, coercive non-equality with the not equal comparison operator ( != ).

assert.deepEqual(actual, expected, [message])
Tests for deep equality.

assert.notDeepEqual(actual, expected, [message])
Tests for any deep inequality.

assert.strictEqual(actual, expected, [message])
Tests strict equality, as determined by the strict equality operator ( === )

assert.notStrictEqual(actual, expected, [message])
Tests strict non-equality, as determined by the strict not equal operator ( !== )

assert.throws(block, [error], [message])
